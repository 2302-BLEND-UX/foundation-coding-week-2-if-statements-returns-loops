# If statements, returns, loops, random numbers
## Includes a random loot generator

- This lesson focussed on how to test conditions using if statements, like if a variable is greater or equal to a number

- It also covered how we can make our code "clean" by returning data from functions

- Using returns within if statements means we don't need to use an else statement afterwards, which makes our code more readable too
